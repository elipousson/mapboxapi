</h2>
<p>A core skill for analysts practicing location intelligence is
<em>geocoding</em>. Geocoding refers to the conversion of a
<em>description of a place</em> to geographic coordinates - typically
longitude (X) and latitude (Y). The most common place description that
we use is an address, which will vary in form around the world.</p>
<p>mapboxapi offers an interface to <a href="https://docs.mapbox.com/api/search/geocoding/" class="external-link">Mapbox’s brand-new
v6 Geocoder</a> as of package version 0.6. Let’s explore some of its
features.</p>
<p>Basic address geocoding, or <em>forward geocoding</em>, is
implemented with the <code><a href="../reference/mb_geocode.html">mb_geocode()</a></code> function.
<code><a href="../reference/mb_geocode.html">mb_geocode()</a></code> accepts a description of a place, then returns
a length-2 vector of XY coordinates representing the location of that
place. Let’s try it out.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">

<pre><code><span><span class="co">## [1] -73.98184  40.75158</span></span></code></pre>
<p><code><a href="../reference/mb_geocode.html">mb_geocode()</a></code> also accepts <em>structured input</em> as
an R list, which is useful when you want to clearly specify components
of an address. Here’s an example of how that works:</p>

<pre><code><span><span class="co">## [1] -73.98184  40.75158</span></span></code></pre>
<p><code><a href="../reference/mb_geocode.html">mb_geocode()</a></code> can also return a <em>simple features
object</em> with the option <code>output = "sf"</code> . Let’s assign
the result of <code><a href="../reference/mb_geocode.html">mb_geocode()</a></code> to a variable, get an sf object
back, then map it interactively with Mapbox GL JS via the
<strong>mapgl</strong> R package.</p>

coordinates and attempts to convert those coordinates into a description

<h3 id="workflow-batch-geocoding">Workflow: batch geocoding<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#workflow-batch-geocoding"></a>
</h3>
<p>One-off geocoding as illustrated above is very useful in targeted
analyses and when building web mapping apps (more on this later in the
vignette). For larger analyses, however, you’ll want to geocode
addresses in bulk. This process is called <em>batch geocoding</em>.</p>
<p>Batch geocoding typically involves sending a table of addresses to a
geocoding service and getting back XY coordinates for all of those
addresses. With v6 of its geocoder, Mapbox opened up batch geocoding to
all users, which is now implemented in the latest release of
mapboxapi.</p>
<p>Let’s try it out with a real-world dataset. We’ll be working with a
dataset of Adult Residential Care facilities in the state of California,
<a href="https://sandbox.data.ca.gov/dataset/community-care-licensing-adult-residential-facility-locations/c05efa69-8a1f-457e-8a34-9070c664bae6" class="external-link">obtained
from the State of California Open Data portal</a>. You can find this
dataset in mapboxapi’s GitHub repository in <code>vignettes/data</code>.
We’ll read in the dataset with <code><a href="https://readr.tidyverse.org/reference/read_delim.html" class="external-link">readr::read_csv()</a></code>.</p>

<p>We notice that the dataset has over 25,000 rows. It is a perfect
candidate for geocoding, as it describes the locations of each adult
care facility but doesn’t include longitude and latitude, so it can’t
currently be mapped. While we <em>could</em> geocode all of these
facilities - Mapbox’s free tier offers 100,000 free geocodes per month -
this isn’t necessary. Let’s instead clean up the dataset and filter down
to a specific county - Ventura County to the west of Los Angeles.</p>

<p>A <em>simple features</em> object of geometry type POINT is returned.
<code><a href="../reference/mb_batch_geocode.html">mb_batch_geocode()</a></code> tries to make geocoding as simple as
possible for you: table of addresses in, sf object out ready for mapping
and analysis. We note that new <code>accuracy</code> and
<code>confidence</code> columns are returned in the output object.
<code>accuracy</code> gives you information about the type of geocode <a href="https://docs.mapbox.com/api/search/geocoding/#point-accuracy-for-address-features" class="external-link">(see
the Mapbox documentation for explanations)</a> and
<code>confidence</code> gives you the level of confidence Mapbox has in
the geocoding result, ranging from “exact” to “low”.</p>
<p>Let’s map our geocoded results with clustered circles using the
<strong>mapgl</strong> package.</p>

<h2 id="using-mapboxs-geocoder-in-shiny">Using Mapbox’s geocoder in Shiny<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#using-mapboxs-geocoder-in-shiny"></a>
</h2>
<p><strong>mapboxapi</strong> also helps you build Mapbox’s geocoder
into your Shiny apps. The <code><a href="../reference/mapboxGeocoderInput.html">mapboxGeocoderInput()</a></code> function
allows you to use the Mapbox geocoder as a Shiny input. The geocoding
result is captured as the value of the named input
(e.g. <code>input$geocode</code>), which can be passed downstream to
your analyses or maps in your Shiny app. The package also includes two
functions to help you convert the geocoder’s result into a usable
output: <code><a href="../reference/geocoder_as_xy.html">geocoder_as_xy()</a></code>, which converts to a length-2
vector of longitude and latitude coordinates; and
<code><a href="../reference/geocoder_as_sf.html">geocoder_as_sf()</a></code>, which converts the result to an sf POINT
object.</p>
<p>Here’s a minimal example of how to use
<code><a href="../reference/mapboxGeocoderInput.html">mapboxGeocoderInput()</a></code> in a Shiny app with the Leaflet
package. The code follows below the image - try it out!</p>
